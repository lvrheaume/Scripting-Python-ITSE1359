        "#### I had to rely fairly heavily on a combination of resources to solve the requirements for the assignments. There were some places where colab and the book and I had to do the work sort of like a group project. There's definitely a learning curve with understanding which module does what, and when to call them. You'll see in my work that I called a github component in looking for help to solve some requirements. I know this is similar to what real world working in software development is like, but I do also really have a hard time understanding certain things like the mathmatics involved, as I am old, and I didn't do well in math at any stage of my career or education. I like the satisfaction of getting the answer, and with exploring the capabilities of different methods or strings. I do feel I am getting the hnag of knowing the difference between some of the terms. I also realize that there's historical precedent that python pulls from, and I didn't know that really prior to researching. I didn't know what the ' Sieve of Eratosthenes' was prior to this assignment, for example. Or what the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was, and being frank, I still don't quite know. But I like that I'm learning more than just how to plug characters and numbers into a compiler and calling it a day!\n"
